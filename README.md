# RetailDataAnalysis
The project is to design an order intelligence system which reads invoice data of an ecommerce company and generates KPIs based on the data. This can help companies to analyse trends and current consumer behavioural patterns and offer better and more customised products.

The project involves the following tasks.
1. Reading the sales data from the Kafka server
2. Preprocessing the data to calculate additional derived columns.
3. Calculating the time-based KPIs and time and country-based KPIs
4. Storing the KPIs (both time-based and time- and country-based) for a 10-minute interval into separate JSON files for further analysis.
